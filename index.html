<h1>
    pyGames
</h1>
<p>
    pyGames is a collection of small games created by Leevi Aaltonen and released under MIT license. The program was
    built with Python 3.6.0 and tkinter 8.6. Use the aforementioned versions of Python and tkinter to ensure functionality.
    It's recommended to run pyGames.pyw when playing the game as the .pyw file extension disables the console.
    The program prints an event log into the Python console. Run pyGames.py instead of pyGames.pyw to enable the console.

<h2>
    Main Window
</h2>
<p>
    When the program is run, it creates a Tk window, gives it the title "pyGames" and disables resizing of the window.
    The log message "Launched program" is printed. Then the <b>login()</b> function is called to create the login screen,
    where the player can choose their username. The window's main event loop is initiated.
    Note that some variables are made global to easily allow usage in all functions.
</p>
<h3>Login Screen</h3>
<p>
    When the <b>login()</b> function is called, the program tries to destroy the main menu frame, doing nothing if the frame doesn't exist.
    The log message "Removed menu interface" is printed if the frame was destroyed.
    Then, a frame is created to hold the Tk widgets for the login screen. Three labels, an entry field and a button are created
    and positioned in a grid inside the frame. The log message "Created login interface" is printed after the widgets have been created and positioned.
</p>
<p>
    The variable <b>"user"</b> is set to <b>StringVar()</b>, which is a tkinter function that allows a string variable to be updated simultaneously
    for all widgets using it. A trace is set on the variable to call the <b>charlimit()</b> function every time the variable is updated.
    The function checks the length of the variable and sets the variable to its first 16 characters if it's longer than that.
    The log message "Limited username length (16)" is printed if the user tries to enter more than 16 characters.
</p>
<p>
    The first label, positioned in the top left, displays the characters that cannot be used in the username.
    These characters are forbidden in Windows filenames with the exception of "+", which is used in the game's score files.
</p>
<p>
    The entry field, on the second row, is used for entering the username and is bound to the <b>"user"</b> variable.
    The <b>charlimit()</b> function, explained earlier, prevents entry of more than 16 characters.
    The Enter key is bound to the <b>checkname()</b> function for the entry field. If the Enter key is pressed while the field has focus,
    the function is called. If the username contains none of the forbidden characters and does not consist only of spaces,
    the <b>menu()</b> function is called and the log message "Username is valid" is printed. Otherwise, the log message "Username is invalid" is printed.
</p>
<p>
    The second label, on the left side of the entry field, indicates that a username should be entered.
    The button, on the right side of the entry field, is bound to the <b>checkname()</b> function, explained above.
    The third label, in the bottom left, indicates that the program was created by Leevi Aaltonen in 2017 and released under MIT license.
</p>
<h3>Main Menu</h3>
<p>
    When the <b>menu()</b> function is called, the login frame is destroyed and the "Removed login interface" log message is printed.
    Then, a frame is created to hold the widgets for the main menu.
