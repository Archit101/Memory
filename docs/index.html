<h1>Memory</h1>
<p>
    Memory is a memory game created by Leevi Aaltonen and released under MIT license. The player has to memorize and enter
    a growing string of numbers. The program was built with Python 3.6.0 and tkinter 8.6.
    Use the aforementioned versions of Python and tkinter to ensure functionality.
	The program needs to be able to create directories in the directory it's saved in.
    It's recommended to run Memory.pyw when playing the game.
    The program prints an event log into the Python console and into a log file. Run Memory.py instead of Memory.pyw to enable the console.
</p>
<hr />

<h2>Main Window</h2>
<p>
    When the program is run, it creates a Tk window, gives it the title "Memory" and disables resizing of the window.
    Then the <b>login()</b> function is called to create the login screen,
    where the player can choose their username. The window's main event loop is initiated.
    Note that some variables are made global to easily allow usage in all functions.
</p>

<h3>Login Screen</h3>
<p>
    When the <b>login()</b> function is called, the program tries to destroy the main menu frame, doing nothing if the frame doesn't exist.
    Then, a frame is created to hold the Tk widgets for the login screen. Three labels, an entry field and a button are created
    and positioned in a grid inside the frame.
</p>
<p>
    The variable <b>"user"</b> is set to <b>StringVar()</b>, which is a tkinter function that allows a string variable to be updated simultaneously
    for all widgets using it. A trace is set on the variable to call the <b>charlimit()</b> function every time the variable is updated.
    The function checks the length of the variable and sets the variable to its first 16 characters if it's longer than that.
</p>
<p>
    The first label, positioned in the top left, displays the characters that cannot be used in the username.
    These characters are forbidden in Windows filenames with the exception of "+", which is used in the game's score files.
</p>
<p>
    The entry field, on the second row, is used for entering the username and is bound to the <b>"user"</b> variable.
    The <b>charlimit()</b> function, explained earlier, prevents entry of more than 16 characters.
    The Enter key is bound to the <b>checkname()</b> function for the entry field. If the Enter key is pressed while the field has focus,
    the function is called. If the username contains none of the forbidden characters and does not consist only of spaces,
    the <b>menu()</b> function is called.
</p>
<p>
    The second label, on the left side of the entry field, indicates that a username should be entered.
    The button, on the right side of the entry field, is bound to the <b>checkname()</b> function, explained above.
    The third label, in the bottom left, indicates that the program was created by Leevi Aaltonen in 2017 and released under MIT license.
</p>

<h3>Main Menu</h3>
<p>
    When the <b>menu()</b> function is called, the login frame is destroyed.
    Then, a frame is created to hold the widgets for the main menu. Two labels and four buttons are created.
    The first label labels the "Log out" and "Scores" buttons with the username, indicating that they're related to the user.
    The second label labels the "Play" and "Highscores" buttons with the text "Memory", indicating that they're related to the game.
    The "Log out" button calls the <b>login()</b> function, letting the user choose another username.
    The "Scores" and "Highscores" buttons call the <b>scoredisplay()</b> function to display either the user's scores or all users' highscores.
    The "Play" button calls the <b>memory()</b> function, opening the game in a new window.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>
    When the <b>memory()</b> function is called, a window is created. The window's title is set to "Memory", focus is set
    to the window and resizing is disabled. A frame is created to hold the widgets and stretched to fill the window.
    Some variables are given the value StringVar() to allow simultaneous and global changing of the value.
    The string the player has to remember is set to a number from 0 to 9. The score is set to zero.
    The "toptext" StringVar is set to the game's instructions. The "dstring" (displayed string) StringVar is set to the string defined earlier.
    The "dscore" (displayed score) StringVar is set to "Levels passed: [score]", resulting in "Levels passed: 0" at the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    Three labels, two buttons and an entry field are created. The label at the top is linked to the "toptext" StringVar.
    The label on the left side of the second row is linked to the displayed string. The label at the bottom of the
    window is linked to the displayed score. The Start button is placed on the right side of the second row and the
    Enter button is placed below it. The entry field is placed on the left side of the "Enter" button and linked to the "answer" StringVar.
    The entry field and Start button are disabled at the beginning.
    The <b>start()</b> function is bound to the spacebar when the window has focus, but unbound when specifically the
    entry field has focus. The <b>check()</b> function is bound to the Enter key when the entry field has focus.
</p>
<p>
    When the <b>start()</b> function is called, the displayed string is set to nothing. The entry field and Enter button
    are enabled and the Start button disabled. Focus is set to the entry field. The player must now type enter the string
    from their memory.
</p>
<p>
    When the <b>check()</b> function is called, focus is set to the game window and the entry field and Enter button are disabled.
    The answer, with spaces removed, is compared with the string that was set earlier. The answer is set to nothing, emptying the answer field.
</p>
<p>
    If the answer matches the string, another random number is added to the end of the string. The displayed string is set to the new string.
    The score increases by one and the displayed score is set to show the new score. The Start button is enabled.
</p>
<p>
    If the answer doesn't match the string, the spacebar is unbound from the <b>start()</b> function. The correct form
    of the word "level" is chosen depending on whether or not the score is 1. The "userfilename" variable is set to
    the username with spaces replaced by plus signs.
</p>
<p>
    The program tries to create the "scores" folder, doing nothing if it exists. Then it tries to create the "[userfilename].score"
    and "highscores.score" files in the folder, again doing nothing if the files exist. The user's score file is opened for appending.
    The current time with spaces replaced by plus signs, the score and a new line are added to the file.
</p>
<p>
    A dictionary is created for the highscores. The highscore file is opened for reading and every line is added to the
    dictionary with the username as the key and the score as the value. If the user's current score is higher than the
    user's score in the dictionary, the dictionary is updated. If there isn't an entry in the dictionary with the user's
    name as the key, the entry is created. Every item in the dictionary is written into the highscore file.
    Finally, the game window is set to close after 2 seconds.
</p>
<hr>

<h2>Score Display</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the <b>scoredisplay()</b> function's "name" parameter, some variables are assigned different values. The "Scores" button,
    under the username, calls the function with "user" as the "name" parameter. In this case:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The file to get the displayed scores from is set to the username with spaces replaced with plus signs.</li>
    <li>The title variable is set to "Levels passed by [user]", e.g. "Levels passed by Lewski".</li>
    <li>The title variable for the second column is set to "Time achieved", meaning the date and time the score was achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the "name" parameter is something other than "user", the variables will be assigned different values.
    The "Highscores" button calls the <b>scoredisplay()</b> function with "high" as the parameter, so in this case:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The file to get the displayed scores from is set to "highscores".</li>
    <li>The title variable is set to "Highscores".</li>
    <li>The title variable for the second column is set to "User".</li>
</ul>
<p>
    After the parameter-dependent variables have been determined, the dictionary the scores will be temporarily stored in
    is set to an empty OrderedDict(). Unlike a normal dictionary, the OrderedDict has a determined order.
    The file "scores/[filename].score", for example "scores/lewski.score" or "scores/highscores.score", is opened.
    Every line in the file is inserted into a list with the <b>split()</b> function so that spaces in the file separate list items.
    For example, the line "lewski 11" would result in ['lewski', '11']. After this, the list is added into the OrderedDict
    created earlier so that the first item in the list is the key and the second the value, for example ['lewski', '11']
    would become {'lewski': '11'}.
</p>
<p>
    After the dictionary has been created, if the "name" parameter is not "user", the dictionary is sorted by value
    in descending order. The variables for the displayed scores and either the times or usernames are set as empty strings.
    Then, for every item in the score dictionary, the value and a new line are added to the score variable.
    Likewise, the key and a new line are added to the second variable.
</p>
<p>
    After the variables have been assigned, a window is created for the score display. The window's title is set
    to the title variable, defined earlier, focus is set to the window and resizing is disabled. A frame is created
    to hold the widgets and is set to fill the window. Five labels are created.
</p>
<p>
    The first label, centered on the first row, is set to display the "title" variable.The left label on the second row
    is set to display "Levels passed" and the right label is set to display the second column's title variable.
    The bottom left label is set to display the string containing the scores and the bottom right label is set to
    display the second variable, i.e. either the time or the username.
